This is the repository for computational physics course in the spring term of 2016 in Wuhan University. 
I will publish the homework here as well as some interesting programmes I wrote via Python 2.7.
If you want to give some suggestions or point out errors in my programmes, please contact me at chenfengwhu@gmail.com 

##Ordinary differential equation solving package
There are totally four kinds of algorithms in this package temporarily, including *simple Euler method*, *modified Euler method*, *Second-order Runge-Kutta method*, *Third-order Runge-Kutta method*. 
On the other hand, this package can be also used to solve **differential equation systems**, which also means we can use this package to solve the higher order differential equation.
