###I Wasn't Asleep
   When a group of women got on the car, every seat was already occupied. The conductor noticed a man who seemed to be asleep,  and fearing he might miss his stop, he nudged him and said: "Wake up, sir!""I wasn't asleep," the man answered.
   "Not asleep? But you had your eyes closed."
   "I know. I just hate to look at ladies standing up beside me in a crowded car."
